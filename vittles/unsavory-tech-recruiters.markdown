Hey Morgan,

Hope you are having an awesome Saturday!
 
Your work at Google impressed my team.
 
I am a recruiter for Sumo Logic -- a cloud-based service to ingest, process, and analyze machine data and I thought you would be a good fit on one of our Engineering Teams.

Our system is a highly distributed, fault tolerant, multi-tenant platform that includes bleeding edge components related to search, analytics, messaging and storage. This system ingests and analyzes tens of terabytes of data a day, while making petabytes of data available for search and forensic analysis, and is expected to reach substantially larger scale in the near future. We have funding from Sequoia, Greylock, Accel & Sutter Hill.

You will help build all of the core features of the Sumo Logic product: Payments, Authentication, Real Time Search, Indexing, Machine Learning, Analytics, Ingestion and Real Time Data Processing.

Do you have a few minutes to chat about how a role on our team might be an interesting opportunity for you?

Best,
Nate

Hi Morgan,

Hope your having an awesome weekend!

I realize you might be happy at Google, but I wanted to see if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our engineers.

We have processed over 5 quadrillion logs, constantly scaling out our system to handle the petabytes of data we process daily. Our technology is our true differentiator -- from anomaly detection to our elastic cloud-based multi-tenant service. 

Let me know if you’re free to chat. Thanks Morgan!

Best,
Nate

Hi Nate,

I get a lot of emails like these from a lot of different recruiters. If I replied to all of them, I wouldn't have time to do anything else. But today, your fourth email has inspired me to write back.

> Your work at Google impressed my team.

Google employs on the order of 30,000 engineers. Being impressed that I'm part of Google devalues my individuality and indicates that your company is looking for cogs rather than free thinking people. It would have been much better to find out something about my actual work and start with that.

> We have processed over 5 quadrillion logs

I work at Google. Trying to impress me with numbers is going to be a losing game. If you're trying to entice an engineer at a company like Google, it'd be much better to talk about how your data is interesting rather than how much of it you have.

> Our technology is our true differentiator

At this point in reading your recruiting message, I have no idea what you do. Saying that the technology, rather than the product itself, is a differentiator doesn't give me confidence that there's anything interesting to work on. Talking about the ways that you're harnessing interesting technology to make a compelling product, and briefly explaining that problem, would help interest me.

Hey Morgan, I very much appreciate the feedback. It is usually hard to paint a descriptive message over email. 

I tried to give a brief introduction of the company to spark some sort of interest in learning more, in which case I could better describe how you could be a fit and why you should consider working here over the phone.

I would be happy to answer more questions about what we are doing if you want to set up some time this week to chat.

Best,
Nate

Hey  Morgan,

 I always love to get these types of emails as I feel they help hone my craft. A few things about your email I would love your feedback on, if you don't mind having an open dialogue.

"Google employs on the order of 30,000 engineers. Being impressed that I'm part of Google devalues my individuality and indicates that your company is looking for cogs rather than free thinking people. It would have been much better to find out something about my actual work and start with that."

As I understand it, Google's culture is to not be a cog in a wheel, even though some might feel that way. The Google culture values transparency and freedom. I have never worked there but that is my understand from speaking with many engineers from Google and hearing people like Lazlo speak.  I also realize that the scale of what you are working on is typically much larger than the average engineer. I do this to let candidates know that this is not completely random spam.

As for starting with the technology, I did try to do some research on your background but I know very little other  than you have gone to one of the top CS schools, worked for a great startup and now spent the last 3.75 years at Google. Your resume is quite sparse. Given this little founding knowledge, is there a good way to talk about the work that you've done? Without knowing much, I still know this is probably very relevant and interesting work.

I do realize that Google processes quite a bit of data and petabytes to petabytes, we will never win. The situation we can win is that when we are processing 20PB of data per day, it is with a company 1/300th the size. The impact you can have is massive.  Is there a way that I can better get that idea across? I always feel like it sounds like every other startup email when you mention that though.

"At this point in reading your recruiting message, I have no idea what you do. Saying that the technology, rather than the product itself, is a differentiator doesn't give me confidence that there's anything interesting to work on. Talking about the ways that you're harnessing interesting technology to make a compelling product, and briefly explaining that problem, would help interest me."

Commonly, startups have a unique business strategy or marketing play that might give them a distinct advantage. For us, it is our technology. We have built a log management product in the cloud. Most do not know what that really means, but the core differentiator of our product is really that we are a SaaS cloud based service as opposed to an appliance, which currently serves as the industry standard. Is there a better way I can position the messaging to have people understand the technology?

Thanks for responding,
Nate

Hey Nate,

I seem to be on a never-ending automated email loop of yours. Please don't contact me further. From the template emails I've received from you, I've gained a pretty negative view of how Sumo Logic operates, which probably isn't your intention.

Hey Morgan,

I am very sorry. I don't know why it keeps wanting to send emails to you. I have contacted the company but they have not gotten back to me. I hope you forgive me, it is not my intention to keep sending you emails. 
It should stop.
