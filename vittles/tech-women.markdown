Workplace Hints
====

National Association OPPOSED to Women in Tech

Women in tech can accomplish no more than Men in tech. Why waste time, energy, and money, without results?

Say NO to Women in tech
----

BECAUSE 97% of the women either do not want it, or do not care

BECAUSE it means competition with women instead of co-operation

BECAUSE 80% of the women eligible to work can only (double or annul their husbands' votes)

BECASUE it can be of no benefit commensurate with the additional expense involved

BECAUSE in some cities more tech women than tech men will place software development under petticoat rule

BECAUSE it is unwise to risk the good we have for the evil which may occur
