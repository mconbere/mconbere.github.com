# Laws of Internet Conversation

The internet has found itself full of self-indulgent named "laws". These laws pop up in comments
and message boards, and are usually used in a dismissive manner. Here are some of those laws
and their definitions for the curious. References to these laws can usually be replaced by
the statement, "I don't have anything interesting to say," without ill effect.
