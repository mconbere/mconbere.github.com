# Morgan Conbere's Salary

## Disclaimer

A complete history of my salary as a software engineer in San Francisco. Transparency in salary
information may create an environment where we can reduce salary inequality. I don’t provide this
information to cause social discomfort. Instead, this information may be useful if you are negotiating
a job in a similar line of work and are in an underrepresented and disadvantaged group.

For more information about why I’m providing this, here is some interesting reading:
