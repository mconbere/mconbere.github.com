# Morgan Conbere’s Salary

## Disclaimer

This is a complete history of my salary as a software engineer in San Francisco. I strongly believe that transparency in salary information can create an environment where we can reduce salary inequality. I don’t provide this information to cause social discomfort. Instead, this information may be useful if you are negotiating
a job in a similar line of work and are in an underrepresented and disadvantaged group.

For more information about why I’m providing this, here is some interesting reading:

* [Introducing Open Salaries at Buffer: Our Transparent Formula and All Individual Salaries](http://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/) - “Transparency breeds trust”

* [Gender Equality Is a Myth!](http://shriverreport.org/gender-equality-is-a-myth-beyonce/) - “Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more—commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender”

It’s the latest proof that transparency can level the playing field for women seeking equal pay for equal work.”
